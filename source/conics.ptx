    <title>Slicing a Cone</title>
    <p>
      The conics are the second important class of loci. Unlike lines,
      conic equations involve the squares of the variables. Conics
      are a very old topic in mathematics; their names and definitions
      come from ancient Greece. They are called conics (short for
      conic sections) since they can be formed by taking slices of a
      hollow cone at various angles, as show in <xref
      ref="figure-slicing-a-cone" />. In that figure, there are four
      slices, each steeper than the next. The first horizontal slice
      gives a perfect circle. The second, slightly tilted slice gives
      an ellipse. The third slice, precisely at the angle of the cone,
      give a parabolic. The four slice, steeper than the cone itself,
      gives a hpyerbolc.

      Those are the four shapes: circle, ellipse, parabola and
      hyperbola. I will give two other equivalent
      definitions for each conic: one instrinsically geometric
      definition, and one by algebraic
      equation. For the algebraic equations, I will assume that the
      conic is centred at the origin. (More general conics can be
      formed by shifting the conics centered at the origin. <xref
      ref="section-shifts" /> describes these shifts.)

          An ellipse is a slice of a cone at an angle greater than
          zero but less than the angle of the cone.

        <title>Algebraic Definition</title>
        <p>
          An ellipse (centred at the origin) is described by the
          equation <m>\frac{x^2}{a^2} + \frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1</m>.
          For the numbers <m>a</m> and <m>b</m>, which ever is larger
          is called the <term>semi-major axis</term> which ever is
          smaller is called the <term>semi-minor axis</term>. These
          numbers measure the smallest and largest distances from the
          centre to the edge of the ellipse. These two numbers cannot
          be equal, since that would produce a circle. In the diagram,
          I've drawn an ellipse with <m>a \gt b</m> (so that <m>a</m>
          is the semi-major axis), but that is not necessary. An
          ellipse with <m>b \gt a</m> would be taller than it is wide,
          and <m>b</m> would be the semi-major axis.

          A parabola (centred at the origin) is described by the

          the width of the parabola: a larger <m>a</m> will give a
          narrower and steeper parabola.

        <title>Another Geometric Definition</title>
        <p>
          From your previous mathematical experience, you may be aware
          of another way of writing vertically-aligned parabolas. A
          common way to describe a parabola is by giving a vertex and
          a leading coefficient. The vertex is the peak of the
          parabola and the leading coefficient will describe how wide
          or narrow the parabola is. If the leading coefficient is
          positive, the parabola will open upwards; if negative, the
          parabola will open downwards.  A parabola with vertex
          <m>(a,b)</m> and leading coefficient <m>c</m> is described
          by the equation <m>y = c(x - a) + b</m>. The process of
          taking a quadratic and writing it in vertex form is called
          <term>completing the square</term>. This operation should be
          familiar to you from your high school mathematics, but there
          is also a reminder on the reference materials.

      One of the major motivating problems for conics and analytic
      geometry is the problem of celestial motion <mdash /> how
      planets, moons, stars, comets and other celestial objects move
      and orbit around each other. The Greeks assumed, erroneously,
      that orbits ought to be perfect circles. Johannes Kepler, in the
      16th century, correctly observed that orbits take non-circular
      shapes. He put forward a very convincing theory that orbits have
      shapes which are conics.  This leads to ellipses for objects
      without escape velocity and hyperbolas for those with escape
      velocity. Though not perfect (particularly in complicated
      multi-body problems or when relativistic corrections are
      included), Kepler's model is remarkably accurate. Conics are
      still used as the basic models of orbital paths.
