  <title>What Is Calculus</title>
    <p>
      In almost all universities, the core and starting point of
      academic mathematics is calculus. Why is this so? What is
      calculus and why is it so important? In this introductory
      section, I want to give you a brief idea of what calculus is
      about, as well as provide some motivation for why it ought to be
      studied. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Calculus is the study of the dynamic behaviour of
      functions. Okay, that's a definition, but why does that help?
      What is a function and why is the study of the behaviour of
      functions so central? Why `dynamic'?
    </p>
    <p>
      I am going to spend a whole week in <xref
      ref="chapter-week2"/> to review functions. For now, in brief,
      a function is a mathematical way of encoding a dependance of one
      quantity on another. Mathematics is a descriptive language that
      seeks to capture the quantitative aspects of the world. In the
      world, many quantites depend on other quantaties. In an
      environment, humidity may depend on temperature. In a vehicle,
      fuel efficieny may depend on speed. In an economy, productivity
      may depend on interest rates. A function is the mathematical
      thing that measures these relationship.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is why a function is, arguably, the most important
      mathematical tool for describing the quantitative world. The
      (quantitative) world is not collection of completely seperated
      and independent measurements; it is a collection of deeply
      interconnected systems. It is full of dependencies. The function
      is the tool that describes the reality of the (quantitative)
      world. 
    </p>
    <p>
      In particular, most quantities in the world depend on time and
      change over time. Very little in the world is completely static.
      A function can describe how something changes and evolves over
      time. 
    </p>
    <p>
      In this way, mathematicians use functions to model the world. To
      be able to do so, they need a theory of functions and their
      behaviour. That theory is calculus. 
    </p>
    <p>
      But some of you might now ask: why do we need a new theory? We
      saw functions in high school and the algebraic techniques of
      high school mathematics were pretty good in describing
      functions. This is true: algebra goes a long way to
      understanding functions. However, algebra has one very important
      and significant weakness: it is static. Algebra can calculate
      one unknown quantity from other known quantities, but only it a
      snapshot, a single fixed moment in time. Once quantities start
      changing and shifting, algebra can not longer keep track.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is why we need the new techniques of calculus. Functions
      are dynamic: they are constantly change, constantly in flux.
      They represented systems where nothing is static. The new tools in
      calculus (the derivative, the integral, the infinite series) are
      all ways to understand dynamic systems, where the change is
      happening all around. 
    </p>
    <p>
      In <xref ref="section-population-growth"/>, I'll give more
      specific motivating problems for the course. For now, I hope
      this introduction gives a good concept and motivation. We want
      to describe the (quantitative) world. We observe that in the
      world, quantities are interrelated and interdependent. They are
      also dynamic, constant in flux. To make a mathematical
      description of the world, the description must also be dynamic
      and interdependant. That requires functions, and calculus is the
      study of their dynamic behaviour. 
    </p>
    <p>
      To get to the tools of calculus, I'm going to spend two weeks on
      material that may be review for some of you. In <xref
      ref="chapter-week1" />, I'm going to cover  analytic geometry.
      This is the set of geometric tools we use to understand the
      shape of functions, as well as other shapes in two dimensional
      space. It is necessary for understanding and, in particular,
      visualizing functions. In <xref ref="chapter-week2" />, I'm
      going to talk about the concept of a function and go over the
      main properties and operation. These two chapters are
      preparation for the idea of a calculus, which will properly
      start in <xref ref="chapter-week3" />.
